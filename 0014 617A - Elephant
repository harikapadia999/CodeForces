/*
int x;cin>>x; declares an integer variable x and reads an integer value from standard input (typically the keyboard) and assigns it to x.

(x-1)/5+1 is an expression that calculates the number of groups of five that can be formed from x objects. Here's how it works:

(x-1) subtracts one from x to account for the case where x is a multiple of 5. For example, if x is 15, (x-1) would be 14.
/5 divides (x-1) by 5 to get the number of groups of five that can be formed.
+1 adds 1 to the result to account for the remaining objects that don't form a complete group of five. For example, if x is 15, there are three complete groups of five and three remaining objects, so the result would be 4.
cout<< is an output stream that sends the result to standard output (typically the console).*/
