/*
 we declare four integers: i, j, x, y, and val. i and j are used as counters for the nested for loop to traverse the 5x5 matrix. 
 x and y store the row and column index of the cell containing the first non-zero value, respectively. val stores the current input value.

nested for loops to traverse the 5x5 matrix. 
cin>>val; takes input from the user for each cell of the matrix. 
The if statement if(val)x=i,y=j; checks if the current value of the cell is non-zero, 
and if it is, stores the current row and column index of the cell in x and y respectively.

 calculates the Manhattan distance of the cell containing the first non-zero value from the center of the matrix using the formula |x−3|+|y−3|. 
 abs() is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the row and column indices of 
 the cell containing the first non-zero value and 3 (the center index of the 5x5 matrix).
