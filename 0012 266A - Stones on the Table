/*
nclude the standard C++ library header file bits/stdc++.h.
Define the main function.
Declare integer variables t and n and initialize n to 0.
Read an integer value from the standard input and store it in t.
Declare a character array s with a maximum size of 51.
Start a loop that will execute t times.
Read a single character from the standard input and store it in the current index of s.
If the current character is the same as the previous character in the array (i.e., s[i] == s[i-1]), increment n.
After the loop completes, output the value of n to the standard output followed by a newline character.
Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
