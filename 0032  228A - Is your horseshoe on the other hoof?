/*
int distinct;: This line declares an integer variable named distinct.

distinct = 1;: This line initializes the distinct variable to 1.

if (b != a): This line begins an if statement that checks if b is not equal to a.

distinct += 1;: This line increments the distinct variable by 1 if b is not equal to a.

if (c != a && c != b): This line begins another if statement that checks if c is not equal to a and c is not equal to b.

distinct += 1;: This line increments the distinct variable by 1 if c is not equal to a and c is not equal to b.

if (d != a && d != b && d != c): This line begins a third if statement that checks if d is not equal to a, d is not equal to b, and d is not equal to c.

distinct += 1;: This line increments the distinct variable by 1 if d is not equal to a, d is not equal to b, and d is not equal to c.

cout << (4 - distinct) << endl;: This line outputs the result of the expression (4 - distinct) to the standard output, which is the number of integers that are repeated among the four input values.
