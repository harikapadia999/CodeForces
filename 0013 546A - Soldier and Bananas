/*
This line creates a macro which disables synchronization between the C++ standard input/output streams and the C standard input/output streams. 
This improves the speed of input/output operations.

These lines define the main function and declare three long long variables: k, w, and n. 
They then read in three integers from standard input using cin.

This line calculates the total cost of all the bananas by multiplying the price per banana k by the sum of the first w integers 
(which represents the number of bananas bought). This is done using the formula sum = (n / 2) * (a + b), 
where a and b are the first and last terms of the sum and n is the number of terms.

These lines check if the total cost of all the bananas is less than or equal to n. 
If it is, then the output is "0". If not, then the output is the difference between the total cost and n.
